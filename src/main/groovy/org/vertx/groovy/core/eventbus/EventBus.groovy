/**
 * A distributed lightweight event bus which can encompass multiple vert.x instances.
 * The event bus implements both publish / subscribe network and point to point messaging.<p>
 *
 * For publish / subscribe, messages can be published to an address using one of the {@code publish} methods. An
 * address is a simple {@code String} instance.
 * Handlers are registered against an address. There can be multiple handlers registered against each address, and a particular handler can
 * be registered against multiple addresses. The event bus will route a sent message to all handlers which are
 * registered against that address.<p>
 *
 * For point to point messaging, messages can be sent to an address using one of the {@code send} methods.
 * The messages will be delivered to a single handler, if one is registered on that address. If more than one
 * handler is registered on the same address, Vert.x will choose one and deliver the message to that. Vert.x will
 * aim to fairly distribute messages in a round-robin way, but does not guarantee strict round-robin under all
 * circumstances.<p>
 *
 * All messages sent over the bus are transient. On event of failure of all or part of the event bus messages
 * may be lost. Applications should be coded to cope with lost messages, e.g. by resending them, and making application
 * services idempotent.<p>
 *
 * The order of messages received by any specific handler from a specific sender should match the order of messages
 * sent from that sender.<p>
 *
 * When sending a message, a reply handler can be provided. If so, it will be called when the reply from the receiver
 * has been received. Reply messages can also be replied to, etc, ad infinitum<p>
 *
 * Different event bus instances can be clustered together over a network, to give a single logical event bus.<p>
 *
 * Instances of this class are thread-safe
